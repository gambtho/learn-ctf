# Introduction
In the Linux Privilege Escalation article we explained steps you can take to help you gain root privileges. Sometimes you'll need to exploit a system vulnerability to gain root privileges. In this article we explain ways to exploit Linux systems once you have a shell.

# Search for an appropriate exploit
Using the system information you've gained from enumeration, search for appropriate exploits based on the OS version and installed applications.

Exploit Database, US CERT CVE database, Google, GitHub, etc. are all good places to find potential vulnerabilities. Once you've identified a vulnerability, you'll need to find an exploit you can use. Creating your own exploits are not covered in this article. Rather, we are looking for exploits that are already created that are available to you.

# Find directories where you can read, write, and execute from
Often you'll have to download the exploit to a folder on the system. You'll need to find a directory you can write to download anything. Use the following command to find directories from the command line with the ```find``` command that have read, write, and execute permissions set.
```
find / -perm -777 -type d 2>/dev/null
```

Often the /tmp directory has the appropriate permissions for an attacker to use as a staging area for exploits.
