# Introduction
In the Linux Privilege Escalation article we explained steps you can take to help you gain root privileges. Sometimes you'll need to exploit a system vulnerability to gain root privileges. In this article we explain ways to exploit Linux systems once you have a shell.

# Search for an appropriate exploit
Using the system information you've gained from enumeration, search for appropriate exploits based on the OS version and installed applications.

Exploit Database, US CERT CVE database, Google, GitHub, etc. are all good places to find potential vulnerabilities. Once you've identified a vulnerability, you'll need to find an exploit you can use. Creating your own exploits are not covered in this article. Rather, we are looking for exploits that are already created that are available to you.

# Find directories where you can read, write, and execute from
Often you'll have to download the exploit to a folder on the system. You'll need to find a directory you can write to download anything. Use the following command to find directories from the command line with the ```find``` command that have read, write, and execute permissions set.
```
find / -perm -777 -type d 2>/dev/null
```

Often the /tmp directory has the appropriate permissions for an attacker to use as a staging area for exploits.

# Compiling exploit
Often you may only have the source code for an exploit as opposed to a pre-compiled binary. In this case you'll need to upload the exploit source code to the staging directory and compile and execute from there.

Before you upload your code make sure you read through it to understand what it does. Oftentimes, proof-of-concept exploit code needs to be modified to work correctly on the target system. Modifications may be include things like changing the code to work with a 64-bit or 32-bit OS or applying some set of credentials.

Once you've made the appropriate modifications, it's time to compile the code. You can compile the code with a command similar to:
```
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
```
Make sure the code compiled correctly! Sometimes you need to set certain compiler flags for the code to compile correctly.

Afterwards you should be able to run your exploit with the following command:
```
./exploit
```

If you can't run the exploit you may need to ```chmod``` it to make it executable. Use the following command to make the exploit executable for your user:
```
chmod 700 exploit
```

Assuming everything went correctly, you'll either have root or you'll be one step closer to getting root credentials on your target.
