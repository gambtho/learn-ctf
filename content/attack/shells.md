# Introduction
A shell is a user interface that gives interactive access to a host. Typically shells that attackers user will be on a command line interface (CLI).

On Linux the most common shell is Bash and on Windows the most common shell is cmd.exe and PowerShell. The shells on both Linux and Windows systems allow a user to interact with the system in almost any way he wants as long he has the appropriate permissions.

Learning how to use Bash or cmd.exe or PowerShell is outside of the scope of this lessons here. You can find entire books written on the subject of learning how to use those shells.

I'll refer you to the references section for more resources on learning shell interfaces.
