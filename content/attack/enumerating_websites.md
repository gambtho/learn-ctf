# Introduction
Often times networks are accessible through some sort of public web site. One of the keys to successfully gaining a foothold on a network is to enumerate a website and gather more information and find vulnerabilities.

There are a variety of tools to automate the task of enumerating websites. We won't cover all of the tools here in this article but we will cover some of the more popular tools. Additionally, [Nmap](http://learn.greyhatctf.com/attack/nmap/) can also be used to enumerate websites using NSE scripts.
