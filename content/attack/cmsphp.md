# Introduction
A web content management system (CMS) is a application which supports the creation and management of web pages. The most popular of the web CMSs is WordPress. The two other most popular CMSs after WordPress are Joomla and Drupal. Web CMS generally perform similar functions so attacks on WordPress CMSs will tend to generalize to other CMSs. 

One of the key features of web CMSs is that they typically support dynamic web content through the usage of PHP which is a server-side scripting language. Because the server executes PHP code to serve web pages, if an attacker can control the PHP code that the server executes, then the attacker can gain remote code execution on the web server.
