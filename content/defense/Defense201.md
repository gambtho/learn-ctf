# Welcome to Defense 201

Congratulations!  You finished Defense 101 and are moving up in the world.  The last scenario consisted of challenges requiring basic log analysis skills and basic threat intelligence research to accomplish.  This scenario will build on what we learned in Defense 101 and extend to other areas like file triage analysis and some WireShark techniques that are often required.  Below we will run through a few examples and resources that will help you complete this scenario.

## Wireshark File Extraction from HTTP Traffic

Be sure you have downloaded [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).  You may also want to explore other tools like NetworkMiner, but for the purposes of this CTF, we'll be using Wireshark.

Getting started with Wireshark


## Wireshark File Extraction from HTTP Traffic

Extracting files from HTTP traffic is surprisingly easy with Wireshark.  


## WireShark File Extraction from FTP Traffic

Extracting files from an FTP stream is slightly more complicated, but Wireshark does make it easy for you.

## Remnux - Viper
