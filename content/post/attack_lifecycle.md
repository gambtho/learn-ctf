# The Attack Lifecycle

## Introduction
Cyber attackers have an operating cycle that is common across many attacks. This cycle can be called the attack lifecycle. There are various models to explain how the lifecycle works by many different organizations including Lockheed Martin, Palo Alto Networks, and Mandiant (see References section for links). If you read each variation of the lifecycle you will find that you can summarize the lifecycle into reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and actions on objective phases. 

The purpose of this article is to give you a mental model of how real attackers operate. By understanding the attack lifecycle you will be able to incorporate the same cycle into penetration testing. The main difference between real attacks and penetration testing is the enforcement of strict limits on what you can exploit and what you can do on your objective. In the following sections, I will summarize each stage of the attack lifecycle.

In the following sections, I use the the term attacker in the singular form but often attackers operate in teams. I will still use the singular form even when referring to teams of attackers.

### Reconnaissance

### Exploitation

### Privilege Escalation

### Actions on Objective
