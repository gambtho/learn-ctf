      <description>Purpose The purpose of this training material is to provide enough basics to get a good start on each of the challenges. At the same time, you will be acquiring and practicing the necessary skills to be an effective cyber threat detection analyst.
Guiding Principles Whether we like it or not, we must accept that our systems and networks will be compromised and we need to assume that is already the case.</description>

      <description>Getting Elastic Stack Running In the first set of challenges, we will be analyzing Bro Network Security Monitoring (NSM) logs consisting of both benign and malicious traffic. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with Bro NSM logs, you soon will be. For this set of challenges, you are provided with a set of tools, mostly docker-compose and docker files that launch analysis environments and give you access to the forensic artifacts to base your analysis on.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Defense 101 In this first scenario, we will become familiar with Elasticsearch and Kibana as well as get our feet wet digging into a well known banking trojan. We&amp;rsquo;ll start off easy and progress into increasingly challenging questions as we go.
Your Elastic Stack Instance You should now have a working instance of Elastic Stack running locally. If you plan to continue to use that as your analysis platform, then you will find the resources below helpful.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Defense 201 Congratulations! You finished Defense 101 and are moving up in the world. The last scenario consisted of challenges requiring basic log analysis skills and basic threat intelligence research to accomplish. This scenario will build on what we learned in Defense 101 and extend to other areas like file triage analysis and some WireShark techniques that are often required. Below we will run through a few examples and resources that will help you complete this scenario.</description>
